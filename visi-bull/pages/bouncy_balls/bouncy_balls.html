<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
    Balls bounce around their enclosure using their individual speed and angle of movement.
    When they hit a wall, their angle of movement is recomputed in order to ensure that they bounce off the wall at the appropriate angle.
</p>
<p>
    The balls can be interacted with through clicking or dragging them.
    If you click on a ball, then it will be placed in the bucket to the right of the enclosure.
    If there is a ball in the bucket, then clicking inside the enclosure will shoot a ball out of the mouse tip.
    Balls can be dragged and released to 'throw' them around the box.
    The speed with which you release the ball determines the speed at which it moves following its release.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Dragging and Clicking</h3>
<p>
    The ability to both drag and click a ball was achieved by recording the number of drag update calls made during the entire drag event.
    If this number was one or none, then a click was assumed to have been performed.
    Allowing one drag update to count as a click gives a little leeway in cases where the mouse is moved imperceptibly during the click.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Crisp SVG Text</h3>
<p>
    Text ('Speed' and the tick marks) was made crisper by setting the <code class="html"><span class="attribute">stroke</span></code> attribute to
    <code class="html"><span class="value">"none"</span></code> in the text element tags, and using only the
    <code class="html"><span class="attribute">fill</span></code> attribute to style the text.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Moving Balls Between the Enclosure and the Bucket</h3>
<p>
    Balls are transitioned between the enclosure and the bucket by removing them from the DOM and then adding them back.
    This can be achieved by:
    <pre class="code"><code class="javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> ball = ...  <span class="comment">// Select the ball to move.</span>
ball.remove();
<span class="keyword">var</span> target = ...  <span class="comment">// Select either the enclosure or bucket.</span>
target.append(<span class="keyword">function</span>() { <span class="keyword">return</span> ball.node(); });</code></pre>
    where <code class="javacsript">target</code> is the enclosure (if moving the ball from the bucket to the enclosure) or the bucket (if
    moving the ball in the opposite direction).
    The ball is removed from the DOM using <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#remove">selection.remove()</a>,
    and can then be added back through the use of a function when you're appending.
</p>
<p>
    Balls that are in the bucket need to be made undraggable. This is done by giving them a new drag behaviour when they're added to the bucket.
    This new behaviour causes dragging the balls to do nothing, and is implemented as:
    <pre class="code"><code class="javascript">d3.behavior.drag()
    .origin(<span class="keyword">function</span>(d) {<span class="keyword">return</span> d;})
    .on(<span class="string">"dragstart"</span>, null)
    .on(<span class="string">"drag"</span>, null)
    .on(<span class="string">"dragend"</span>, null);</code></pre>
</p>
<p>On returning the ball to the enclosure, the drag behaviour can be reverted to the appropriate behaviour for a bouncing ball.</p>
<br>
<h3>Bucket Outline</h3>
<p>
    The bucket that the balls are placed in after being clicked on is created using <code class="html"><span class="attribute">stroke-dasharray</span></code>
    and <code class="html"><span class="attribute">stroke-dashoffset</span></code> attributes to style the border of the rectangle that defines the bucket.
    A polyline or manually created three sided path could be used instead.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Slider Bar</h3>
<p>
    The slider bar is a styled axis with an additional path added. The default path created when adding an axis is:
    <pre class="code"><code class="html"><<span class="element">path</span> <span class="attribute">class</span>=<span class="value">"domain"</span> <span class="attribute">d</span>=<span class="value">"..."</span>></code></pre>
    This gives you a path that you can style as follows to get the outer black color:
    <pre class="code"><code class="html"><span class="element">svg</span> <span class="class">.domain</span> {<span class="attribute">fill</span>: none; <span class="attribute">stroke</span>: black; <span class="attribute">stroke-linecap</span>: round; <span class="attribute">stroke-width</span>: 13;}</code></pre>
    The inner pinkish bar for the slider is added by:
    <pre class="code"><code class="javascript">axis.select(<span class="string">".domain"</span>)  <span class="comment">// Select the path with the domain class that is created along with the axis.</span>
    .select(<span class="keyword">function</span>() { <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">this</span>.parentNode.appendChild(<span class="keyword">this</span>.cloneNode(<span class="keyword">true</span>)); })  <span class="comment">// Clone .domain and select the clone.</span>
    .classed(<span class="string">"halo"</span>, <span class="keyword">true</span>);</code></pre>
    The new path is then styled as follows:
    <pre class="code"><code class="html"><span class="element">svg</span> <span class="class">.halo</span> {<span class="attribute">fill</span>: none; <span class="attribute">stroke</span>: #FF008C; <span class="attribute">stroke-linecap</span>: round; <span class="attribute">stroke-width</span>: 7;}</code></pre>
    While the ideal naming would have the <code class="html"><span class="class">.domain</span></code> class being the inner pinkish portion of the slide bar,
    as the axis <code class="html"><span class="class">.domain</span></code> path is added first it will appear behind the
    <code class="html"><span class="class">.halo</span></code> path, and therefore must be styled as the outer black portion.
    Alternatively, the <code class="html"><span class="class">.halo</span></code> path could be inserted before the
    <code class="html"><span class="class">.domain</span></code> path, in which case it would appear behind the
    <code class="html"><span class="class">.domain</span></code> path, and the stylings for the classes could be swapped (and the class names would be
    more logical).
