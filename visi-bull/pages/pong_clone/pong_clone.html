DEAL WITH HITTING THE TOP OF THE PADDLE
	Do this by splitting the paddle area into a top rectangle, bottom rectangle, side rectangle, and then quarter circles around the edges
	The quarter circles will have the same radius as the ball
	The quarter circles will be further split in half along a line bisecting it from the corner
	The eighth circles closer to the side rectangle will count as hitting the side, the eighth circles closer to the top/bottom will count as hitting the top/bottom
