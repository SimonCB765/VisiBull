<h3>Components of Carousels</h3>
<p>Demo placeholder fill patterns to be used in the carousel demos.</p>
<svg id="patternDemo" />
<br>
<p>
	Works in three steps: first create carousel container rect, then generate items, then construct carousel around them.
	Carousel does not care about the items, just needs them to have certain format.
</p>
<p>
	Item construction needs to take:<br>
	Number of items to show. Defaults to 1. 
	Heights - an array that if not probided defaults to an array containing one item, which is the height of the carousel containing rect (minus the border width of the items and minus any vertical padding desired). 
	Widths - an array that if nt provided defaults to an array containing one item, which is the width computed in order to make all items fit in the carousel. 
	H padding - an array that if not provided defaults to an array containing only 0. 
	V padding - an array that if not provided default to a pre-specified value (like 10 or something). 
	Items record their own height and width as bound data, along with their horizontal and vertical padding
</p>
<p>
	For carousel need to know:<br>
	Whether to center items. 
	Whether to loop infintiely. 
	How many items to skip by each time you advance left or right. Defaults to 1. Can not be larger than the number of items to show.

<h3>Single Item Carousels</h3>
<p>Not infinite looping (fade out arrow on side when reach end, but still allow dragging to just give empty space) (Responsive design - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>Infinite Looping (Multiple items - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<br>
<h3>Multiple Item Carousels</h3>
<p>Not infinite looping (fade out arrow on side when reach end, but still allow dragging to just give empty space) (Responsive design - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>Infinite Looping (Multiple items - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>Slide a set number of items out of the viewfinder on arrow click (give some text box where this can be changed).</p>
<br>
<h3>Centered Carousels</h3>
<p>Infinite and non-infinite for all.</p>
<p>Have the center item highlighted in some way, and make it so that the center item is really in the center (require odd number of items). (center mode - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>Variable width items. The viewport width has to take into account the X widest neighbouring items, where X is the number of items in the viewport at once). (variable width - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>Click on an item to center it in the carousel.</p>
<br>
<h3>Unique Carousels</h3>
<p>Funky 3Dish carousel with all items in view (http://adam.co/lab/svg/carousel.html).</p>
<p>Autoplaying carousel. Let's you drag and arrow still, but autoplays. Make it break autoplay when you mouse in, and restart when mouse out. (autoplay - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>One where you can drag the individual items to reorder them and to scroll (also has arrows). i.e. mouse drags the image, mouse ets close to left edge, carousel starts turning left slowly, mouse is released, carousel stops and image drops in</p>
<p>One with a drop down box (or maybe just a context menu on right clicking the carousel) that lets you choose item to jump to, and then rotates carousel to the item.</p>
<p>Fade in and out on transition (best keep it to one item). (fade - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
<p>Add and remove items (add & remove - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).</p>
<p>Filter items in some way. (filtering - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/).</p>
<p>Sync two sliders, one smaller than the other, like a small overview and closeup on focussed on. (Slider syncing - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)</p>
